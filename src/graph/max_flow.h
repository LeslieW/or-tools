// An implementation of a push-relabel algorithm for the max flow problem.
//
// In the following, we consider a graph G = (V,E,s,t) where V denotes the set
// of nodes (vertices) in the graph, E denotes the set of arcs (edges). s and t
// denote distinguished nodes in G called source and target. n = |V| denotes the
// number of nodes in the graph, and m = |E| denotes the number of arcs in the
// graph.
//
// Each arc (v,w) is associated a capacity c(v,w).
// A flow is a function from E to R such that:
// a) f(v,w) <= c(v,w) for all (v,w) in E (capacity constraint.)
// b) f(v,w) = -f(w,v) for all (v,w) in E (flow antisymmetry constraint.)
// c) sum on v f(v,w) = 0  (flow conservation.)
//
// The goal of this algorithm is to find the maximum flow from s to t, i.e.
// for example to maximize sum v f(s,v).
//
// The starting reference for this class of algorithms is:
// A.V. Goldberg and R.E. Tarjan. A new approach to the maximum flow problem.
// ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 136-146.
// http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=12144
//
// The basic idea of the algorithm is to handle preflows instead of flows,
// and to refine preflows until a maximum flow is obtained.
// A preflow is like a flow, except that the inflow can be larger than the
// outflow. If it is the case at a given node v, it is said that there is an
// excess at node v, and inflow = outflow + excess.
// More formally, a preflow is a function f such that:
// 1) f(v,w) <= c(v,w) for all (v,w) in E  (capacity constraint). c(v,w)  is a
//    value representing the maximum capacity for arc (v,w).
// 2) f(v,w) = -f(w,v) for all (v,w) in E (flow antisymmetry constraint)
// 3) excess(v) = sum on u f(u,v) >= 0 is the excess at node v, the
//    algebraic sum of all the incoming preflows at this node.
//
// Each node has an associated "height", in addition to its excess. The
// height of the source is defined to be equal to n, and cannot change. The
// height of the target is defined to be zero, and cannot change either. The
// height of all the other nodes is initialized at zero and is updated during
// the algorithm (see below). For those who want to know the details, the height
// of a node, corresponds to a reduced cost, and this enables one to prove that
// the algorithm actually computes the max flow. Note that the height of a node
// can be initialized to the distance to the target node in terms of number of
// nodes. This has not been tried in this implementation.
//
// A node v is said to be *active* if excess(v) > 0.
// In this case the following operations can be applied to it:
// - if there are *admissible* incident arcs, i.e. arcs which are not saturated,
//   and whose tail's height is lower than the height of the active node
//   considered, a PushFlow operation can be applied. It consists in sending as
//   much flow as both the excess at the node and the capacity of the arc
//   permit.
// - if there are no admissible arcs, the active node considered is relabeled,
//   i.e. its height is increased to 1 + the minimum height of its neighboring
//   nodes on admissible arcs.
// This is implemented in Optimize, which itself calls PushFlow and Relabel.
//
// Before running Optimize, it is necessary to initialize the algorithm with a
// preflow. This is done in InitializePreflow, which saturates all the arcs
// leaving the source node, and sets the excess at the heads of those arcs
// accordingly.
//
// The algorithm terminates when there are no remaining active nodes, i.e. all
// the excesses at all nodes are equal to zero. In this case, a maximum flow is
// obtained.
//
// TODO(user): implement the following active node choice rule.
//
// The complexity of this algorithm depends amongst other things on the choice
// of the next active node. It has been shown, for example in:
// L. Tuncel, "On the Complexity of Preflow-Push Algorithms for Maximum-Flow
// Problems", Algorithmica 11(4): 353-359 (1994).
// and
// J. Cheriyan and K. Mehlhorn, "An analysis of the highest-level selection rule
// in the preflow-push max-flow algorithm", Information processing letters,
// 69(5):239-242 (1999).
// http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~jcheriya/PS_files/me3.0.ps
//
// that choosing the active node with the highest level yields a complexity of
// O(n^2 * sqrt(m)).
//
// This has been validated experimentally in:
// R.K. Ahuja, M. Kodialam, A.K. Mishra, and J.B. Orlin, "Computational
// Investigations of Maximum Flow Algorithms", EJOR 97:509-542(1997).
// http://jorlin.scripts.mit.edu/docs/publications/
//     58-comput%20investigations%20of.pdf
//
// TODO(user): an alternative would be to evaluate:
// A.V. Goldberg, "The Partial Augment-Relabel Algorithm for the Maximum Flow
// Problem.‚Äù In Proceedings of Algorithms ESA, LNCS 5193:466-477, Springer 2008.
