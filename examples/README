Operations Research libraries. </summary>

  - %Constraint Solver Examples:
    - costas_array.cc Solves the problem of Costas Array (an constrained
      assignment problem used for radars) with both version,
      a feasibility version with hard constraints, and an optimization version
      with soft constraints and violation costs.
    - cryptarithm.cc Demonstrates basic modeling objects (integer variables,
      arithmetic constraints and expressions, simple search).
    - golomb.cc Demonstrates how to handle objective functions and collect
      solutions found during the search.
    - jobshop.cc Demonstrates scheduling of jobs on different machines.
    - magic_square.cc Shows how to use the automatic search to solve your
      problem.
    - model_util.cc A utility to manipulate model files (.cp) dumped by the
      solver.
    - network_routing.cc Solves a multicommodity mono-routing
      problem with capacity constraints and a max usage cost structure.
    - nqueens.cc Solves the n-queen problem. It also demonstrates how to break
      symmetries during search.

  - Routing Examples:
    - cvrptw.cc Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows.
    - tsp.cc Travelling Salesman Problem.

  - Graph Examples:
    - flow_example.cc Min-Cost Flow and Max-Flow sample problems.
    - solve_dimacs_assignment.cc Solves DIMACS challenge on assignment
      problems.
    - linear_assignment_example.cc Demonstrates how to use the Linear Sum
      Assignment solver.

  - Linear Solver Examples:
    - column_generation.cc Complex example that demonstrates how to use dynamic
      column generation to solve a 2D covering problem.
    - integer_solver_example.cc Demonstrates how to use the linear solver
      wrapper API to solve Mixed Integer Programming problems.
    - linear_solver_example.cc Demonstrates how to use the linear solver
      wrapper API to solve Linear Programming problems.
    - linear_solver_example_with_protocol_buffers.cc Demonstrates how protocol
      buffers can be used as input and output to the linear solver.
