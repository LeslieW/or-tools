This file describes how to install the constraint-solver library and
run the c++ and python examples. This has been tested under ubuntu
10.04 and onward, Mac OS X Snow Leopard with xcode 3.2 and up, Mac OS X Lion,
and Microsoft Windows with Visual Studio 2010 express C++.

Upon untarring the given operation_research tar file, you will get the
following structure:
