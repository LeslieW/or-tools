This file describes how to install the constraint-solver library and
run the c++ and python examples. This has been tested under ubuntu
10.04 and 10.10, Mac OS X Snow Leopard with xcode 3.2.3, and 3.2.4,
and Microsoft Windows with Visual Studio 2010 express C++.

Upon untarring the given operation_research tar file, you will get the
following structure:

operations_research-1.0/
  LICENSE-2.0.txt    <- Apache License
  Makefile           <- Makefile for unix platform (ubuntu linux, mac os X)
  Makefile.msv       <- Makefile for Microsoft Visual Studio
  README             <- This file
  algorithms/        <- Directory containing basic algorithms.
  base/              <- Directory containing basic utilities.
  constraint_solver/ <- The main directory for the constraint solver library
  examples/          <- C++ examples
  graph/             <- Graph algorithms used in the constraint solver
  objs/              <- Where C++ objs files will be stored
  python/            <- Python examples
  util/              <- More utilities needed by the constraint solver
